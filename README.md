# TurfWars
Origionally developed by MyNameIsTriXz | MCPE TurfWars minigame

I said i will never release the fixed ver but i dont want it anyways

## How to use
```
1. Move this folder to PocketMine/plugins
2. Now place in your default level a sign with §d[§9TW§d] in its first line and TW-1 in its second line, because this plugins pastes a level called TW-1 into your world folder if there isn't one, that's why you need to write TW-1 into the second line, if you want to have more levels, then you should copy, rename and paste to PocketMine/worlds TW-1 to TW-2, TW-3... and so on, then write the levelname on the second line of the join sign.
```
Done
